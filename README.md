# GEE2-Heritability-Twins
R code tutorials for the methods developed in Arbet et al 2020 "A Robust and Unified Framework for Estimating Heritability in Twin Studies using Generalized Estimating Equations"

twinACEmodels.R : contains R functions for fitting GEE2-Falconer and GEE2-NACE models for estimating heritability in twin studies.
example1_nocovariates.R : example of estimating heritability with no covariate effects
example2_meanlevel_covariates.R : example of estimating heritability while allowing for mean-level covariates.
example3_variancelevel_covariates.R : example allowing heritability to differ by covariates (e.g. sex)
